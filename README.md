# **Summary**
---
1. The majority of Airbnb properties are concentrated in Watthana and Khlong Toei neighborhoods. This shows that Airbnb properties are more popular in the city center, which is due to the presence of business centers, major tourist attractions, shopping malls, and good accessibility to public transportation.
2. Neighborhoods like Dusit, Bangkok Yai, and Samphangthawong have a relatively low number of Airbnbs located in the center of Bangkok. This could be an opportunity to explore and develop the market in these areas, either through increasing the number of Airbnb properties or through more intensive marketing strategies.
3. The findings suggest that there is great potential for Airbnb in areas like Nong Chok that are far from the city center. This may be due to various factors, including more affordable property prices, quieter neighborhoods, and good accessibility to the city center.
4. Dominance of Entire Home/Apartment and Private Room: The finding that the number of Entire home/apartment and private room Airbnb types are dominant suggests that many guests are looking for a more private and exclusive stay in the area.

2. Pricing Strategy Adjustment: The highest median price is in the suburban area of Nong Chok Neighborhood. Therefore, the marketing team should direct their pricing strategy to match the market preferences in that area.
